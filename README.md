- `src` folder contains the source files for each coding challenge.
- `tests` folder contains the corresponding test files.
- `README.md` provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the tests.
- `package.json` includes project metadata and dependencies.

## How to Run Tests
Please install Node.js and npm before run tests ([Click here](#install-nodejs-and-npm) for instructions on installing Node.js and npm).

1. Install Jest by running:
```
npm install --save-dev jest
```
2. Run the tests:
```
npm test
```
This will execute all the unit tests and provide feedback on the functionality of the implemented solutions.

## Install Node.js and npm:
### For Windows/Mac:

1. Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the LTS version (recommended for most users).
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

### For Linux:

You can install Node.js and npm using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

### Verify Installation:

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```
